      <description>Clang/LLVM is a toolchain that is widely adopted by both researchers and the industry. Based on LLVM, compilers for new targets are built, and program analysis solutions are developed, thanks to the well-defined LLVM IR. Nevertheless, Clang/LLVM is also famous for some of its strange (often just &amp;ldquo;different&amp;rdquo; from gcc) behaviors and very aggressive optimizations.
Recently I am working on LLVM (7.0) for program analysis and instrumentation, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to write about how we are dealing with unwanted optimizations.</description>
